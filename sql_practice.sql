-- Chinook Database is installed for practice

-- Dew to old tables we had created using csv their are complecations are arise we need to solve that first

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Dropping Older Artists, Albums, Track Table of old data as we installed chinnok db 

drop table tracks;

-- Now Changing column name to origenal one as chinnok db has 
alter table artists rename artist_id to artistId;
alter table albums rename artist_id to artistId;
alter table albums rename album_id to albumId;
alter table tracks rename album_id to albumId;
alter table tracks rename unit_price to unitPrice;
